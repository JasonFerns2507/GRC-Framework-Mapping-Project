# GRC Project: Security Policy & Framework Mapping

### Objective
This project demonstrates the ability to map internal security policy controls to a major, industry-standard cybersecurity framework. The revised Acceptable Use Policy was analyzed, and its key rules were mapped to the relevant controls within the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. This is a common and critical task for GRC analysts, showing alignment with security best practices.

### 1. The Policy Document
The analysis was performed on the revised **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**, which was updated to include a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) program.

### 2. The NIST CSF Mapping
The following table maps specific statements from the policy to their corresponding NIST CSF Function, Category ID, and Subcategory ID.

| Policy Statement | NIST Function | NIST Category ID | NIST Subcategory ID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3.1. Employees are responsible for the security of their assigned user accounts... | Protect | PR.AC | PR.AC-1 |
| 4.1. All personal devices...must be protected by a secure passcode... | Protect | PR.AC | PR.AC-7 |
| 4.2. The device's storage must be encrypted.| Protect| PR.DS| PR.DS-1 |
| 4.5. When accessing...on public Wi-Fi, employees must use the company-provided VPN. | Protect | PR.DS | PR.DS-2 |

A complete version of this mapping is also available as a CSV file in this repository.
